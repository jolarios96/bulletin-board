(Work in Progress)
This is a sim of an app that allows users in a group to post and track favors that anyone in the group can take if it is convenient.

If you live with a group, or are close to your neighbors, this app would allow you to have a shared list of items or requests, another member can purchase if they happened to be near a grocery store.
